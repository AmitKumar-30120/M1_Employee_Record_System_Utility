## Git Inspector

# Employee Record System
The mini project Employee Record System, a console application has been made using the c programming language. I am going to make this project in Visual Studio Code and push it into Github using all the required softwares like git,vs code and github platform. Using this application user can do basic employee company relatinship like adding employee info, viewing stored employees info, search employees. 
# Research
__Objective:__

* Earlier the records of employees had to be stored through pen paper mode, which was hectic to maintain and keep the record for longer period of time. The aim of this project is to minimize the task of maintaining records of a company. The application enables its user to add,view,search and delete at a very faster pace

__Cost and Feature:__

* Earlier record management was done manually. Easily Add,View,Search,Delete records with password protected access.

* Who

    Any Corporate,School,College,Medical or any other oraganization who has lot of employees and very challenging to maintain the records.

    As the comapanies grows so is their employees, this required the need of a complete database management system.

* Where

    This hectic work of maintainig the records of thousands of employees is like everwhere the globe.

* How

    This project takes all the required input values and produces the output based on that.

## **Swot Analysis:**

## Strengths:
a) Simple & Easy to Use.

b) Increased Employee detail Record.

c) Efficient Data Management.

d) Highly Secure, Scalable & Reliable. 

e) Mobile Access.

## Weakness:
a) The data stored is prone to cyber hacks.

b) Costly and Expensive.

c) Complicated to operate.

d) Online Systems require high-speed internet connectivity.

e) Risk of computer virus.

## Opportunities:
The Employee Record System leaks outward into new spaces, spaces which it didn’t inhabit before, such as reading lists repositories, learning systems, research data management and so forth. Furthermore, it is likely that the future of Employee Record systems will consist of a mixture of open and closed systems as well as local and shared (or hosted) services.

## Threats:
Employee date is now send and retrieve data from databases to help better manage inventory and the like, but some Employe Record don’t have the right data encryption practices in place. This can often lead to lost data and sometimes, the data easily obtainable by criminals.
